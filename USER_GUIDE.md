## Tips & Best Practices

### Data Entry Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent with Categories**: Use the same category names to get accurate analytics
2. **Enter Transactions Regularly**: Don't let them pile up - enter them daily or weekly
3. **Use Descriptions**: Add notes to help you remember what transactions were for
4. **Date Accuracy**: Use the actual transaction date, not the entry date

### Portfolio Management Tips

1. **Update Prices Regularly**: Refresh prices at least once a day for accurate portfolio value
2. **Track Cost Basis**: Always enter your actual purchase price for accurate gain/loss calculations
3. **Diversify**: Use the Asset Allocation chart to ensure you're not too concentrated in one type
4. **Long-term View**: Use the Portfolio Value chart to focus on long-term trends, not daily fluctuations

### Data Backup

Your data is stored locally in SQLite. To backup:

```bash
# Create backup
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Prism/prism.db ~/Documents/prism_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Restore from backup
cp ~/Documents/prism_backup_YYYYMMDD.db ~/Library/Application\ Support/Prism/prism.db
```

**Recommended**: Back up your database weekly or after major data entry.

### Performance Tips

1. **Close unused tabs**: If you have many assets, closing Reports tab can improve performance
2. **Archive old data**: Consider exporting and removing very old transactions
3. **Limit price refreshes**: Don't refresh too frequently (5-minute cache helps)

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't start

**Solution**:
1. Check Python version: `python3 --version` (must be 3.11+)
2. Verify virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Check for error messages in terminal

### Prices won't update

**Possible causes**:
- No internet connection
- API rate limit reached (wait 5-10 minutes)
- Invalid ticker symbol

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify ticker symbols are correct
3. Try refreshing individual assets by editing and re-saving
4. Check API status:
   - CoinGecko: https://status.coingecko.com/
   - Yahoo Finance: Try accessing finance.yahoo.com

### Charts not displaying

**Possible causes**:
- No data entered yet
- Date range filter excluding all data
- PyQt6-WebEngine not installed

**Solutions**:
1. Add some transactions or assets first
2. Change date range filter to "All Time"
3. Reinstall: `pip install PyQt6-WebEngine`

### Database errors

**Possible causes**:
- Database file corrupted
- Insufficient disk space
- File permissions issue

**Solutions**:
1. Check disk space: `df -h`
2. Check file permissions: `ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/Prism/`
3. Restore from backup if available
4. Last resort: Delete database (‚ö†Ô∏è loses all data) and restart app

### App is slow

**Possible causes**:
- Too many transactions/assets
- Charts rendering on large datasets
- Background price updates running

**Solutions**:
1. Close Reports tab when not needed
2. Use date filters to limit data displayed
3. Wait for price updates to complete
4. Consider archiving old data

## FAQ

### Is my data stored in the cloud?

**No**. Prism stores all data locally on your computer in a SQLite database. Your financial data never leaves your machine (except when you explicitly export it).

### Do I need an API key?

**No**. Prism uses free APIs (CoinGecko and Yahoo Finance) that don't require API keys. These are subject to rate limits but sufficient for personal use.

### Can I use this on Windows or Linux?

**Mostly**. Prism is designed for macOS but the code should work on Windows/Linux with minor adjustments (paths, shortcuts). The .app bundle is macOS-specific.

### How often should I refresh prices?

**Recommendation**: Once or twice per day is sufficient for most users. The app caches prices for 5 minutes to avoid excessive API calls.

### Can I import transactions from my bank?

**Not yet**. CSV import is planned for a future version. Currently, you must enter transactions manually.

### Is my data encrypted?

**Not yet**. The current MVP stores data in plain text SQLite. Database encryption and password protection are planned for future versions.

### Can I track multiple currencies?

**Not yet**. Currently, all amounts are assumed to be in euros (‚Ç¨). Multi-currency support is planned for future versions.

### What happens if I delete the database?

All your data will be lost. Make sure to back up regularly! The app will create a new empty database on next launch.

### Can I sync across devices?

**Not yet**. Each installation has its own local database. Cloud sync is planned for future versions.

### How do I update the app?

Currently, you need to manually pull the latest code from Git:

```bash
cd prism
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Auto-update functionality is planned for future versions.

### What's the maximum number of transactions/assets I can have?

SQLite can handle millions of records, but performance may degrade with very large datasets (10,000+ transactions). Use date filters and consider archiving old data.

### Can I customize categories?

**Yes**! The category field is free-text with auto-complete. Just type any category name you want. Common categories are pre-populated for convenience.

### How accurate are the price updates?

Prices come directly from CoinGecko (crypto) and Yahoo Finance (stocks), which are reliable sources. However:
- Prices may be delayed by a few minutes
- Some assets may not be available on these platforms
- Exchange rates affect accuracy for non-euro assets

### Can I track options or derivatives?

**Not currently**. Prism is designed for simple assets (crypto, stocks, bonds). Complex financial instruments may be added in future versions.

### What if I find a bug?

Please report bugs on GitHub Issues with:
- Description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Error messages (if any)
- Your macOS version and Python version
